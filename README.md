# Pitch-Perfect

The Pitch Perfect app is result of Intro to iOS App Development with Swift lesson of Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree course.

The App allows users to Record a sound using the Deviceâ€™s Microphone. It then Allows Users to Play the Recorded Sound back with six different Sound Modulations: Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Slow, Fast with Reverb and Echo effect.

## Implementation

Pitch Perfect has two Scenes:
- RecordSoundsViewController : 
Consists a record button with a microphone image. Tapping this microphone button starts an audio recording session and present a stop button. When the stop button is clicked, the app completes recording and then show the PlaySound controller.

- PlaySoundsViewController : 
Contains six buttons to play the recorded sound file with different effects related to the button image and a stop button at the bottom

The App supports both orientations. I have varied traits for the landscape orientation of PlaySoundsViewController to make it look good with the use of stack views. App also gives a nice Pop Animation when ever we change the orientation.

The application uses code from AVFoundation to record sounds from the microphone (AVAudioRecorder) and play recorded audio with effects (AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioEngine).

## Requirements

- Xcode 8 Above
- Swift 3.0
